Description: This repository contains a project focused on developing a health-related chatbot fine-tuned on the BioGPT model using the PubMed QA labeled dataset. The chatbot allows users to ask health-related yes/no questions. Upon receiving an input, the system processes it and generates relevant responses in three sections: first, a brief research-based context; second, a detailed answer with scientific reasoning; and third, a clear yes or no decision based on the available evidence. The goal of this project is to provide users with quick, accurate, and scientifically-informed insights to help guide their health-related decisions.

Problem: Medical decision-making often requires quick, reliable insights based on scientific research and clinical data. However, the overwhelming amount of medical literature and the complexity of interpreting this information can be a challenge for individuals seeking accurate guidance on health-related queries


Aim:The MediChat chatbot aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured, research-backed response to medical inquiries. By leveraging the BioGPT model, the chatbot generates answers in three distinct sections:
Context: An overview of the relevant research and studies.
Answer: A direct response based on the available evidence.
Decision: A simple, yes/no decision to guide users in their health-related decision-making.
